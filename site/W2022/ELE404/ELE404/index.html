<p>We will now go over the actual application of diodes and ways to analyze them.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Diode Rectifier and Filter One of the most
important applications of diodes is in the design of rectifier
circuitsconvert an AC voltage to a DC voltage. There's two types:
half-wave and full-wave rectifier.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/1/dc_power.png" width="80%" />
:::</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Half-Wave Rectifier The half-wave rectifier
utilizes alternate half-cycles of the input sinusoid. The circuit is
shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/1/hw1_rectifier.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The circuit functions as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Positive Cycle:</dt>
<dd>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in} \geq v_D\)</span>, the output voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = v_{in} - v_D\)</span>, due
to the constant-voltage-drop diode.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Negative Cycle:</dt>
<dd>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in} &lt; v_D\)</span>, the output voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = 0\)</span>, since the diode
is reverse-biased.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that for an ideal diode, the voltage drop would be <span class="arithmatex">\(v_D = 0\)</span>, as
shown in the left. However, since these do not actually exists, we use a
more realistic model, as shown in the right.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="4cm" src="../Figure/1/hw_graph.png" />
:::</p>
<p>As you can see in the graph, a half-wave rectifier has a low energy
efficiency as half of the input is wasted.</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Half-Wave Rectifier with a Filter Capacitor
In order to filter out the ripples, a large capacitor <span class="arithmatex">\(C\)</span> is
neededreducing the substantially the variations in the rectifier output
voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span>. The circuit is shown below</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/1/hw2_rectifier.png" />
:::</p>
<p>As a result, when <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in}\)</span> drops from its peak, the capacitor will
discharge, instead of a dropping all the way to <span class="arithmatex">\(\SI{0}{\volt}\)</span>.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/1/hwc_graph.png" width="7cm" />
:::</p>
<p>A closer look at the output voltage, we can derive a few equations. The
peak voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(V_P\)</span> is the maximum value of the DC source, where
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_P = v_{in,\ max} - v_D\)</span>\)</span> The ripple voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(V_r\)</span> is the residual
periodic variation of the DC voltagethe difference between <span class="arithmatex">\(V_P\)</span> and the
voltage when discharging ends.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_r = \frac{T}{\tau}V_P = \frac{V_P}{fR_LC} = \frac{i_L}{fC}\)</span>\)</span> The
output DC voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{v_O}\)</span> can be obtained by taking the average
of the extreme values of <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span>.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{v_O} = V_P - \frac{1}{2}V_r\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Full-Wave Rectifier The full-wave rectifier
has improve efficiency, by utilizing both halves of the sinusoid. The
circuit is shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/1/fw1_rectifier.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The circuit functions as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Positive Cycle:</dt>
<dd>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in} \geq v_D\)</span>, the upper diode <span class="arithmatex">\(D_1\)</span> will be ON, while
lower diode <span class="arithmatex">\(D_2\)</span> will be OFF, and the output voltage
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = v_{in} - v_D\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Negative Cycle:</dt>
<dd>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in} \leq -v_D\)</span>, the upper diode <span class="arithmatex">\(D_1\)</span> will be OFF, while
lower diode <span class="arithmatex">\(D_2\)</span> will be ON, and the output voltage
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = |v_{in}| - v_D\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/1/fw_current.png" width="90%" />

<p>The output voltage is shown below.</p>

:::</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Full-Wave Rectifier with a Filter Capacitor
Likewise, a large shunt capacitor is used to filter out voltage ripples.
The circuit is shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="3.25cm" src="../Figure/1/fw2_rectifier.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The only notable difference that can be seen from the graph is the
period <span class="arithmatex">\(T\)</span> cut in half.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/1/fwc_graph.png" width="7cm" />
:::</p>
<p>The peak voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(V_P\)</span> is still the same as previously shown, where
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_P = v_{in,\ max} - v_D\)</span>\)</span> For the ripple voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(V_r\)</span>, the period
<span class="arithmatex">\(T\)</span> is replaced by <span class="arithmatex">\(T/2\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(2f\)</span>, resulting in
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_r = \frac{V_P}{2fR_LC} = \frac{i_L}{2fC}\)</span>\)</span> As in the half-wave case,
the output DC voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{v_O}\)</span> doesn't change.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{v_O} = V_P - \frac{1}{2}V_r\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Bridge Rectifier A cheaper implementation of
the full-wave rectifier with no center-tapped transformer. However, it
uses two diodes in conjunction, resulting in a bigger voltage loss. The
circuit is shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/1/b1_rectifier.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The circuit functions as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Positive Cycle:</dt>
<dd>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in} \geq 2v_D\)</span>, the diodes <span class="arithmatex">\(D_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(D_2\)</span> will be ON, while
diodes <span class="arithmatex">\(D_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(D_4\)</span> will be OFF, and the output voltage
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = v_{in} - 2v_D\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Negative Cycle:</dt>
<dd>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in} \leq 2v_D\)</span>, the diodes <span class="arithmatex">\(D_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(D_2\)</span> will be OFF, while
diodes <span class="arithmatex">\(D_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(D_4\)</span> will be ON, and the output voltage
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = |v_{in}| - 2v_D\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/1/b_current.png" width="\textwidth" />
:::</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Bridge Rectifier with a Filter Capacitor
Let's apply a capacitor again to filter out the ripples. The circuit is
shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="3.25cm" src="../Figure/1/b2_rectifier.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Like the full-wave rectifier, the period is also half <span class="arithmatex">\(T/2\)</span> of the input
wave.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/1/fwc_graph.png" width="7cm" />
:::</p>
<p>However, the peak voltage has a bigger voltage loss of <span class="arithmatex">\(2v_D\)</span> due to the
two diodes. <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_P = v_{in,\ max} - 2v_D\)</span>\)</span> The ripple voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(V_r\)</span> is
the same as stated in the full-wave rectifier
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_r = \frac{V_P}{2fR_LC} = \frac{i_L}{2fC}\)</span>\)</span> The same case for the
output DC voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{v_O}\)</span> which also doesn't change.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{v_O} = V_P - \frac{1}{2}V_r\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Voltage Regulator A voltage regulator is a
circuit whose purpose is to provide a constant DC voltage between its
output terminalsto further reduce the voltage ripple.</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Resistor-based Voltage Regulator The
resistor-based voltage regulator is not the most ideal as you'll see
why. The circuit is shown below</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="3cm" src="../Figure/1/resistor_vr.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The output voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> is given by
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = \frac{R_L \parallel R_2}{R_L \parallel R_2 + R_1}V_{CC}\)</span>\)</span> For an
ideal voltage regulator, we want <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> to be independent of <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span>, as
it's something we have no control over. Though one may consider the case
if <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L \gg R_1, R_2\)</span>, then <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L \parallel R_2 \approx R_2\)</span>
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O \approx \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}V_{CC}\)</span>\)</span> While <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> is independent
of <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span>, there are still some flaws in the design:</p>
<p>(1) It is still proportional to <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC}\)</span>resulting in <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> fluctuating
    based on <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC}\)</span></p>
<p>(2) Since <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span> is very small, a very large current will flow
    through them; resulting in a rapid increase of temperature and
    smoke.</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Diode-based Voltage Regulator Suppose we now
replace <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span> with a forward-biased diode, as shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="3.5cm" src="../Figure/1/diode_vr.png" />
:::</p>
<p>If you recall, the equivalent of a forward-biased diode is to a small
voltage source <span class="arithmatex">\(\SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span> in series with small resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(r_D\)</span>.
The ideal output voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> is given by <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O = 0.7N\)</span>\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> is
the number of diodes cascaded and <span class="arithmatex">\(r_D = \SI{0}{\ohm}\)</span>. Note that
<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC} &gt; 0.7N\)</span> is required. However, the actual value of <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> is
determined by including <span class="arithmatex">\(r_D\)</span>. By performing KCL at node <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span>, we get
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(G_L(v_O) + G(v_O - V_{CC}) + g_D(v_O - 0.7) = 0\)</span>\)</span> Note that the
resistance is converted to conductance to minimize the use of fraction,
where
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(G = \frac{1}{R} \to G_L =  \frac{1}{R_L} \text{ and } g_D = \frac{1}{r_D}\)</span>\)</span>
Isolating for <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span>, we get the actual output voltage which is given by
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O \approx 0.7 \bigg[1 + \frac{GV_{CC}}{0.7g_D} - \frac{G_L + G}{g_D}\bigg]\)</span>\)</span>
We can determine the sensitivity of <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC}\)</span> to see
how much it fluctuates by
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{dv_O}{dR_L} = \frac{0.7}{g_D} = 0.7r_D \hspace{4cm} \frac{dv_O}{dV_{CC}} = \frac{G}{g_D} = \frac{r_D}{R}\)</span>\)</span>
Since <span class="arithmatex">\(r_D\)</span> is typically a small value, where <span class="arithmatex">\(r_D \ll R, R_L\)</span> or
<span class="arithmatex">\(g_D \gg G, G_L\)</span>, the output voltage is less sensitive to both <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC}\)</span>
and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span>, thus making it a good voltage regulator.</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Zener-diode-based Voltage Regulator Let's
now consider a Zener diode, which is reverse-biased, as shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="3.5cm" src="../Figure/1/zener_vr.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Likewise, we can also draw the equivalent circuit of a Zener diode as
such. Then by performing KCL at node <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span>, we get
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(G_Lv_O + G(v_O - V_{CC}) + g_Z(v_O - V_{Z0}) = 0\)</span>\)</span> and isolating for

<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_O \approx V_{Z0}\bigg[1 + \frac{GV_{CC}}{V_{Z0}g_Z} - \frac{G_L + G}{g_Z}\bigg]\)</span>\)</span>
The sensitivity of <span class="arithmatex">\(v_O\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC}\)</span> are
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{dv_O}{dG_L} = -\frac{V_{Z0}}{g_Z} = -V_{Z0}r_Z \hspace{4cm} \frac{dv_O}{dV_{CC}} = -\frac{G}{g_Z} = \frac{r_Z}{R}\)</span>\)</span>

<p>-4ex -1ex -.4ex 1ex .2ex Operation of BJT If you notice from the diagram
earlier, the transistor consists of two pn junctions, the emitter--base
junction (EBJ) and the collector--base junction (CBJ). Depending on the
bias condition of each of these junctions, different modes of operation
of the BJT are obtained, as shown below.</p>

<p>Let's define the bias conditions for modes of operation in the EBJ.</p>

<p>The order of subscript matter, which implies the order in which they are
calculated. For NPN, <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{BE} = V_B - V_E\)</span>, whereas for PNP,
<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{EB} = V_E - V_B\)</span>. Likewise, the same implies for <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CB}\)</span> and
<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{BC}\)</span>.</p>

<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{BE} &gt; \SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{EB} &gt; \SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span>,
electrons or holes in the emitter will exit and move to the base or

<p>::: list</p>
<p>Technically, the diode is forward-biased when <span class="arithmatex">\(V &gt; 0\)</span> and the diode is
negative biased when <span class="arithmatex">\(V &lt; 0\)</span>. However, we account for the voltage drop
in diode, in this scenario, which is <span class="arithmatex">\(\SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span>.
:::</p>
<p>Figuratively, we can describe it using the <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>-<span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span> relationship of the
emitter-base junction:</p>

<img alt="image" height="3cm" src="../Figure/2/mode_graph.png" />

<p>Note that the small region in between cut-off and active region is not
the saturation regionwill get to this in a bit. Just know that we do not
operate in this region.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Cut-Off Mode In cut-off mode, the EBJ is in
reverse bias (<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{BE} &lt; \SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span> for NPN and
<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{EB} &lt; \SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span> for PNP), which means no emitter current,
<span class="arithmatex">\(i_E = 0\)</span>. Since <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_E = i_C  + i_B\)</span>\)</span> where the emitter current <span class="arithmatex">\(i_E\)</span> is
equal to the sum of the collector current <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C\)</span> and base current <span class="arithmatex">\(i_B\)</span>.
We have <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C = 0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(i_B = 0\)</span>. The transistor is essentially inactive,
thus appears as an open-circuit.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" src="../Figure/2/cutoff_equiv.png" width="80%" />
:::</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Active Mode Of the three modes, the active
mode is the most important. In active mode, the EBJ is in forward bias
(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{BE} &gt; \SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span> for NPN and <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{EB} &gt; \SI{0.7}{\volt}\)</span> for
PNP) and the CBJ is in reverse bias.</p>
<p>We'll focus on the NPN transistor, but note that PNP transistor operates
in the similar manner. As a reminder, current and electron flow are
backwards:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since the EBJ is forward-biased (the diode is ON), free electrons
    from the emitter region can easily cross the emitter-base junction.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="5cm" src="../Figure/2/active_mode1.png" />
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you remember, the base is lightly doped, so only a small
    percentage of the free electrons can recombine with the holes in the
    base region, which produces a small <span class="arithmatex">\(i_B\)</span>.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="5cm" src="../Figure/2/active_mode2.png" />
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The free electrons that entered the base region but didn't recombine
    with the holes move toward the CBJ which is reverse-biased (the
    diode is OFF), producing <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C\)</span>, such that <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C \gg i_B\)</span>.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="5cm" src="../Figure/2/active_mode3.png" />
:::</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>::: list</p>
<p>The collector region is connected to the <span class="arithmatex">\(+\)</span> of <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CB}\)</span>, so free
electrons in the base region are attracted to the <span class="arithmatex">\(+\)</span> side and are swept
across into the collector region, despite the diode being
reverse-biased. Refer to the zoomed-in diagram in the right.
:::</p>
<p>In order to use the BJT as an amplifier, it should be operated in the
active region. The conceptual circuit for NPN is shown below to
illustrate the operation of the transistor as an amplifier.</p>

</li>

transistor models: large-signal equivalent circuit and small-signal

<img alt="image" height="3.5cm" src="../Figure/2/amplifier_dc.png" />
:::</p>
<p>An important thing to make note of, since <span class="arithmatex">\(i_B \ll i_C\)</span>, we have the
approximation <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_E \approx i_C\)</span>\)</span> So you may often see <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(i_E\)</span>
interchange. The collector current can be expressed as
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\label{eq:collectorcurrent}
    i_C \approx I_Se^{v_{BE}/V_t}\)</span>\)</span> If you notice, this is equivalently
the equation for diode current. The base current can be expressed as a
fraction of the collector current
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_B = \frac{i_C}{\beta} = \bigg[\frac{I_S}{\beta}\bigg]e^{v_{BE}/V_t}\)</span>\)</span>
where <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta\)</span> is a transistor parameter. Note for PNP, replace <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{BE}\)</span>
with <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{EB}\)</span>. We can form a set of relations between <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(i_B\)</span>, and
<span class="arithmatex">\(i_E\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_C = \alpha i_E \hspace{2cm} i_C = \beta i_B\)</span>\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span>
is related to <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta\)</span> by <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\beta + 1}\)</span>\)</span> We can
express the emitter current as <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\label{eq:emitter_nobase}
    i_E = i_B + i_C = \frac{i_C}{\alpha} = \bigg[\frac{I_S}{\alpha}\bigg]e^{v_{BE}/V_t}\)</span>\)</span></p>

would look like</p>

<p>This circuit does not account for the base-width modulation, which
occurs when the connector-emitter voltage is increased. As noted in ,
the collector current is only affected by <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{BE}\)</span>, but not by <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{CE}\)</span>.
:::</p>
<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit (with

connector-emitter voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{CE}\)</span>, that the collector current <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C\)</span>
will remain constant. However, this is not the case as you'll see from

:::</p>
<p>In reality, <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C\)</span> does depends on <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{CE}\)</span>. It varies linearly with
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_{CE}\)</span>. This is due to the Early effect, which we can derive the
equation of the slope, by</p>
<p>::: center

<p>So our collector current can be expressed as

Alternatively, the preferred way of writing is expressed as
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_C \approx I_Se^{v_{BE}/V_t} + g_ov_{CE}\)</span>\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(g_o\)</span> is the output

One very important thing to make note of, <span class="arithmatex">\(r_o\)</span> is not a physical
resistorits intended to quantify the impact of base-width modulation
onto the circuit; more-so an artificial parameter.</p>

<p>-4ex -1ex -.4ex 1ex .2ex Load Line and Maximum Signal Swing Recall that
a transistor is optimal as an amplifier when operating in the active
region. The load line is a line drawn on the characteristics curve.</p>
<p>::: center

:::</p>
<p>The load line can be expressed as <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_C = \frac{V_{CC} - v_{CE}}{R_c}\)</span>\)</span>
The intersection of the load line and <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C-v_{CE}\)</span> curve with
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_{BE} = V_{bias}\)</span> gives us the DC operating point (or the bias point).
Once the operating point is established you essentially know how to bias
the transistor optimallyeither by varying <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{bias}\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(R_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>::: list</p>
<p>Note that it is normally done by varying <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{bias}\)</span> in the circuit, as
varying <span class="arithmatex">\(R_c\)</span> affects gain, which will get to in a bit.
:::</p>
<p>Two important considerations in deciding the location of the DC
operating point are the gain and allowable signal. In deciding the value
for <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{bias}\)</span>, it is useful to refer to the <span class="arithmatex">\(i_C-v_{CE}\)</span> curve:</p>

:::</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If DC operating point is too close to the boundary of active and
    saturation regions, the max signal swing will be smaller (shown on
    the left).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If DC operating point is too close to <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{CC}\)</span>, the max signal swing
    will be smaller (shown on the right).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the DC operating point, we can determine the lower and upper bounds
of <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o\)</span> signal swing coming from <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in}\)</span> in the circuit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The lower bound can be expressed as <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{o,\,total,\,min} = V_{sat}\)</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>::: center

</li>
<li>
<p>Common-Base (CB) Amplifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common-Collector (CC) Amplifier</p>

<p>Each has distinctly different attributes and hence areas of application,
which will cover in each section.</p>

:::</p>
<p>The purpose of each component are explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The signal source represents the Thevenin equivalent of the signal
    generator with an internal resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(R_s\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two isolating capacitors <span class="arithmatex">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(C_2\)</span> are used to separate
    the AC signals from the DC biasing voltageby passing AC signals and
    blocking any DC component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It uses two resistors <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span> to generate DC biasing voltage
    <span class="arithmatex">\(V_B\)</span> at the basereferred to as voltage divider biasing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose <span class="arithmatex">\(R_c\)</span> is known, we can express the optimal <span class="arithmatex">\(V_B\)</span> that yields the
max output voltage swing shown in which is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_B = V_t\ln{\bigg[\frac{V_{CC}-V_{sat}}{2I_SR_c}\bigg]}\)</span>\)</span> Since <span class="arithmatex">\(V_B\)</span>
is generated by a DC biasing voltage, we'll rewrite <span class="arithmatex">\(V_B\)</span> in terms of
<span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span>. In order to derive this equation, we need to consider
two possible cases:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Case 1:</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span> small, <span class="arithmatex">\(I_B\)</span> can ignored since
<span class="arithmatex">\(I_{R1},I_{R2} \gg I_B\)</span>. Therefore, we can apply voltage division to
determine <span class="arithmatex">\(V_B\)</span>, such that <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_B = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}V_{CC}\)</span>\)</span> One
downside to this is that it will consume more (DC) power.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Case 2:</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span> are large, <span class="arithmatex">\(I_B\)</span> can no longer be ignored since
<span class="arithmatex">\(I_{R1},I_{R2}\)</span> is now comparable to <span class="arithmatex">\(I_B\)</span>, where the current splits
from <span class="arithmatex">\(I_B\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(I_{R2}\)</span>. Performing KCL at node B yields
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_B = \frac{G_1V_{CC} - (I_C/\beta)}{G_1 + G_2}\)</span>\)</span> Note that
<span class="arithmatex">\(G_1 = 1/R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(G_2 = 1/R_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(I_C = \beta I_B\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since we always prefer to reduce power consumption, we make <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and

The voltage gain is expressed by the following formula:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\label{eq:ce_voltgain}
    A_v = -g_mR_{out} = -g_m(R_c \parallel r_o)\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>::: list</p>
<p>Notice how <span class="arithmatex">\(A_v\)</span> is negative, which indicates a phase inversion from
input to output. In other words, CE amplifier is an inverting amplifier.

<p>The CB amplifier has a low input resistance. This is undesirable as
    it will draw a large current when driven by a voltage input. Refer

<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Characterizing Amplifiers In general, CB
amplifiers should not be used as a voltage amplifiers due to its low
input resistance, <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{in} = r_e\)</span>. To understand why, refer to the
characterization of an amplifier below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/3/amp1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>For amplifiers, a large input resistance is desirable as it reduces the
loading effect of the amplifier on the signal source.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2cm" src="../Figure/3/amp_rin1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The larger the input resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{in}\)</span>, the more the input signal
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_s\)</span> will appear at the input of the amplifier. <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\label{eq:input_volt}
    v_{in} = \frac{R_{in}}{R_s + R_{in}}v_s \approx \bigg(1 - \frac{R_s}{R_{in}}\bigg)v_s\)</span>\)</span>
If you recall, CE amplifiers have a large input resistance, thus making
it a desirable voltage amplifier.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{R_s}{R_{in}} \approx 0 \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad v_{in} \approx v_s\)</span>\)</span>
However, CB amplifiers have a small input resistance, since
<span class="arithmatex">\(r_e = r_{be}/(\beta + 1)\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta\)</span> is around <span class="arithmatex">\(100\)</span>, resulting to
a huge voltage loss from <span class="arithmatex">\(v_s\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose we use a Norton equivalent source, instead of a Thevenin
equivalent source.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2cm" src="../Figure/3/amp_rin2.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Now in this scenario, the signal of the source is current. <span class="arithmatex">\(R_N\)</span> is
designed to be very large, so all the current will be delivered to the
load, oppose to <span class="arithmatex">\(R_s\)</span> in Thevenin equivalent.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_{in} = \frac{R_N}{R_{in} + R_N}i_N \approx \bigg(1 - \frac{R_{in}}{R_N}\bigg)i_N\)</span>\)</span>
So if <span class="arithmatex">\(R_N\)</span> is large enough or <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{in}\)</span> is very small, then all the
current will be delivered to the load.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{R_{in}}{R_N} \approx 0 \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad i_{in} \approx i_N\)</span>\)</span>

<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{in} = r_{be}\)</span>\)</span> The output resistance is:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{out} \approx \frac{1}{g_{m1}} = r_e\)</span>\)</span> The voltage gain is:

<p>Because there is no inversion and <span class="arithmatex">\(A_v \approx 1\)</span>, the output voltage
closely follows the input voltage in both phase and amplitudethus the

<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Characterizing Amplifiers Due to its high
input resistance and a low output resistance, it can be used a voltage
buffer. To understand the use of this, let's look back at the diagram we
used for CB amplifiers.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/3/amp1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Previously, we covered how a high input resistance is more favorable.
Now, we'll focus on the output resistance.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2cm" src="../Figure/3/amp_rout1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>For amplifiers, a small output resistance is desirable, as it increases
the output voltage <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{out}\)</span> that will be delivered to the load resistor
<span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span>.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_L = \frac{R_L}{R_L + R_{out}}v_{out} \approx \bigg(1 - \frac{R_{out}}{R_L}\bigg)v_{out}\)</span>\)</span>
Since CC amplifiers have a small output resistance, such that
<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{out} \ll R_L\)</span>, then
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{R_{out}}{R_L} \approx 0 \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad v_L = v_{out}\)</span>\)</span>
Thus, comes down to the reason we use an emitter follower. As an
example, we have a CE amplifier with a load resistor attached at the
output.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="3cm" src="../Figure/3/emitter_circuit1.png" />

<p>When a load resistor is present, the voltage gain in is now:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\ \text{w/ load}} = -g_{m1}(R_{out} \parallel R_L) = -g_{m1}(r_{o1} \parallel r_{o2} \parallel R_L)\)</span>\)</span>

<dl>
<dt>Case 1:</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L \gg R_{out}\)</span>, then
<span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\ \text{w/ load}} =  A_{v,\ \text{w/o load}}\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span>
will have no impact on the voltage gain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Case 2:</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L \ll R_{out}\)</span>, then
<span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\ \text{w/ load}} \ll  A_{v,\ \text{w/o load}}\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(R_L\)</span>
will have a severe loading impact on voltage gain.</p>
</dd>

<p>A solution to Case 2, if we add an emitter follower stage to lower the

<p>If you recall an emitter follower has a voltage gain of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_v \approx 1\)</span>,
which is good, since it does not alter or change the voltage gain (More

Note that we cannot determine the current ratio simply by <span class="arithmatex">\(W/L\)</span> alone,
as it introduces an uncertainty, since <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{DS1} \neq v_{DS2}\)</span>. If we let

<span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta v_{DS}\)</span> is the difference in voltage between <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{DS1}\)</span> and

<p>-4ex -1ex -.4ex 1ex .2ex Differential Voltage Gain Now let's go over how
voltage is amplified in a differential amplifier. Using the principle of

The differential output is <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\label{eq:diff_output}

<p>By performing KVL, where <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{SS}\)</span> is the node voltage of <span class="arithmatex">\(SS\)</span> then
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(V_{b2} = V_{GS2,3} + V_{SS} \qquad\text{ or }\qquad V_{GS2,3} = V_{b2} - V_{SS}\)</span>\)</span>
Recall the equation for transconductance (in ), then we can express
<span class="arithmatex">\(g_{m2,3}\)</span> as
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(g_{m2,3} = \frac{2I_{DS2,3}}{\underbrace{V_{b2} - V_{SS}}_{V_{GS2,3}} - V_T}\)</span>\)</span>
Now we'll separate our DC and AC components of the differential
amplifier.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="6cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_equiv1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(I_{SS}/2\)</span> represents our DC current, which we already know from and
. The <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta i\)</span> represents our AC current. Then, the current of <span class="arithmatex">\(M_2\)</span>
and <span class="arithmatex">\(M_3\)</span> is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_{DS2} = \frac{I_{SS}}{2} + \Delta i \hspace{2cm} i_{DS3} = \frac{I_{SS}}{2} - \Delta i\)</span>\)</span>
If you remember, a transconductor maps a voltage to a current. So in AC,
we're mapping the <span class="arithmatex">\(v_s/2\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta i\)</span>, which we can say
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta i = g_{m2,3}\bigg(\frac{v_s}{2}\bigg)\)</span>\)</span> If we perform KCL at
the node <span class="arithmatex">\(SS\)</span>, then the current flowing through <span class="arithmatex">\(M_1\)</span> is constant.
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_{DS1} = i_{DS2} + i_{DS3} = I_{SS}\)</span>\)</span> It is independent of the input
source, that is <span class="arithmatex">\(v_s\)</span>, or in other words, it is constantcurrent doesn't

<p>::: center

:::</p>
<p>So in small-signal analysis, the differential amplifier can be split
into two identical common-source amplifiers whose AC outputs are given
by <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^+ = g_{m3}(r_{o3} \parallel r_{o5})\bigg(-\frac{v_s}{2}\bigg)\)</span>\)</span>
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^- = g_{m2}(r_{o2} \parallel r_{o4})\bigg(\frac{v_s}{2}\bigg)\)</span>\)</span>
Note that <span class="arithmatex">\(g_{m2} = g_{m3}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(r_{o2,3} = r_{o4,5}\)</span>. From , the
differential output is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o = v_o^+ - v_o^- = g_{m2,3}(r_{o2,3} \parallel r_{o4,5})v_s\)</span>\)</span> where
the voltage gain is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(A_v = \frac{v_o}{v_i}\times\frac{v_s}{v_i} = g_{m2}(r_{o2} \parallel r_{o4}) = g_{m3}(r_{o3} \parallel r_{o5})\)</span>\)</span>
Notice it has the same voltage gain as that of corresponding
common-source amplifier (in ). It doesn't provide any additional gain,
which might not make sense at first.</p>
<p>But what this provides is a way to deal with supply voltage noise,
without having to worry about the gain being modified for using
differential signaling.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Power Consumption This, however, comes at
the cost of uses twice the power consumption. Since the voltage gain is
the same, under the condition that the both transistors have the same
transconductance <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(g_{m} = \frac{2I_{DS}}{{V_{b2} - V_{SS}} - V_T}\)</span>\)</span>
Then the current <span class="arithmatex">\(I_{DS}\)</span> of each branch of the differential pair, <span class="arithmatex">\(M_2\)</span>
and <span class="arithmatex">\(M_3\)</span>, must be the same as that of CS amplifier.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="6cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_equiv3.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Therefore, the tail current of the differential pair is twice that of
the DC current of CS amplifier. As result, the power consumption of
differential part is <span class="arithmatex">\(2\times\)</span> that of CS amplifier.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Differential-Input Single-Ended-Output
Amplifiers In most scenarios, we only want one output <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o\)</span>, instead of
two outputs <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^+\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^-\)</span>. So how can we modify the differential
amplifier to do such task?</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.5cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_signal4.png" />

<p>It is pretty simple, which involves using a current mirror to perform
differential-to-single ended conversion.</p>
<p>::: center

<p>The output current is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(i_o = 2 \times g_m\bigg(\frac{v_s}{2}\bigg) = g_mv_s\)</span>\)</span> and the output

As you can see, we have a non-inverting amplifier with the same voltage
gain as that of the differential-input differential-output amplifier.</p>
<p>-4ex -1ex -.4ex 1ex .2ex Rejection of Supply Noise Let's now go over the
process of rejecting noise from the supply voltage. We can represent the
supply voltage as <span class="arithmatex">\(V_{DD} +  v_{dd}\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{dd} \ll V_{DD}\)</span>
represents the supply voltage noise.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="4cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_noise1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Our goal is to know whether the differential output of the differential
pair is affected by <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{dd}\)</span> or not. We'll first look at a
differential-input differential-output amplifierstwo inputs and two
outputs.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="5cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_equiv5.png" />
:::</p>
<p>You might have notice we also short-circuited <span class="arithmatex">\(v_s/2\)</span>, even though it's
not constant. The purpose is that we are only interested in the response
of the amplifier due to <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{dd}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Performing KCL at the output nodes <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^+\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^-\)</span> results in
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^+ \approx g_{m5}(r_{o3} \parallel r_{o5})v_{dd}\)</span>\)</span>
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^- \approx g_{m4}(r_{o2} \parallel r_{o4})v_{dd}\)</span>\)</span> As you can see,
the output voltages are a function of the supply voltage noise <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{dd}\)</span>.
However, when we calculate the differential output
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o = v_o^+ - v_o^- = 0\)</span>\)</span> It is <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span>, which means the differential
output is insensitive to supply voltage noise. You can refer to the
diagram below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.9cm" src="../Figure/6/ex_noise1.png" />
:::</p>
<p>When there's noise, it's gonna look the same on both output voltages.
And so when we compare the two output voltages, <span class="arithmatex">\(v_o = v_o^+ - v_o^-\)</span>,
the noise will cancels each other out.</p>
<p>::: center

<p>Now let's look at a differential-input single-ended-output amplifierstwo
inputs and one outputs.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="4.75cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_equiv6.png" />
:::</p>
<p>As we covered in the previous section, we can modify the differential
amplifier, such that there is only one output, but comes at a cost. If
we perform KCL and node <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> and node <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>, we can derive the single-ended
output voltage
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o = \frac{g_{m5}v_A + g_{o5}v_{dd}}{g_{m5} + g_{o3} + g_{o5}}\)</span>\)</span> Then
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o\)</span> is a function of the <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{dd}\)</span>, meaning that differential-input
single-ended output amplifiers cannot reject voltage noise.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Ground Noise As of now we only covered
noise coming from supply voltage, but there's also noise coming from the
ground, that is caused by improper grounding such as a large resistance

<p>When a noise-current enters the ground rail, the potential of the ground
rail is no longer at <span class="arithmatex">\(\SI{0}{\volt}\)</span>fluctuating from <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{ss}\)</span>,
where <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{ss}\)</span> is typically tens of <span class="arithmatex">\(\si{\milli\volt}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using small-signal analysis, we can find the output voltage of the
differential pair caused by <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{ss}\)</span>.</p>

<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o^- \approx g_{m2}(r_{o2} \parallel r_{o4})v_{ss}\)</span>\)</span>
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(v_o = v_o^+ - v_o^- = 0\)</span>\)</span> As with supply voltage noise, the output is
also insensitive to ground noise.</p>
<p>-4ex -1ex -.4ex 1ex .2ex Common-Mode Referring to the diagram below, we
mentioned previously, <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in,\,cm}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{o,\,cm}\)</span> depicts the DC
operating point, whereas <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in,\,AC}^{+,-}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{o,\,AC}^{+,-}\)</span>
carry the information.</p>

:::</p>
<p>Ideally, we want the common-mode input <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in,\,cm}\)</span> to be stable, as it
provides the DC biasing voltage. However, that is something we have no
control over, so instead we should design our differential amplifier to
be insensitive to <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in,\,cm}\)</span> fluctuations.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Common-Mode Voltage Gain The common-mode
voltage gain is defined as
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,cm} = \frac{v_{o,\,cm}}{v_{in,\,cm}}\)</span>\)</span> which can be obtained by
applying both <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in,\,cm}\)</span> to both inputs and measuring either ends of
the single-ended outputs of the differential pair, shown below.</p>
<p>::: center
<img alt="image" height="2.25cm" src="../Figure/6/diff_equiv8.png" />
:::</p>
<p>Ideally, we prefer a common-mode voltage gain <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,cm}\)</span> of <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span>, which
means there's zero fluctuations from the input to output. Similar to
what we did with voltage noise, we will perform small-signal analysis.</p>

:::</p>
<p>A few things to make note of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider <span class="arithmatex">\(r_{o1}\)</span> as the result of two resistors, <span class="arithmatex">\(2r_{o1}\)</span>, to be
    connected in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we have that node <span class="arithmatex">\(SS1\)</span> and node <span class="arithmatex">\(SS2\)</span> to be identical, such
    that no current flows in between the nodes, since they have same
    voltages, <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{SS2} - v_{SS1} = 0\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, we can separate it, forming two sub-circuits, that can be
    identified as a common-source amplifier with source degeneration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From , we can modify it to obtain the common-mode voltage gain, that is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,cm} \approx \frac{-g_{m2,3}(r_{o2} \parallel r_{o4})}{1 + g_{m2,3}(2r_{o1})}\)</span>\)</span>
In order to have a <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,cm} \approx 0\)</span>, the denominator must be very
large. In other words, <span class="arithmatex">\(r_{o1}\)</span> forms source degeneration and
significantly lowers <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,cm}\)</span>.</p>
<p>::: list</p>
<p>Note that <span class="arithmatex">\(r_{o1}\)</span> has no impact on the differential voltage gain.
:::</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex Voltage Gain Comparison To expand a bit
more on the final bit, one of the reason for using a tail current source
(or head current source for PMOS) is to reduce the common-mode voltage
gain. In technicality, we can choose to not add it, as it is indeed
optional.</p>

<p>Both amplifiers still have the same differential voltage gain. However,
the circuit on the left will have a larger common-mode voltage gain. If
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_{in,\,cm}\)</span> fluctuates, in turn, the circuit's input and output will
fluctuate significantly as well.</p>
<p>-3ex -0.1ex -.4ex 0.5ex .2ex CMRR This is one of the parameters we use
quantify amplifiers. We won't go much in-depth regarding this topic, but
a good amplifier should have:</p>

<p>a large differential-mode voltage gain <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,\text{diff}}\)</span>, and
    ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a small common-mode voltage gain <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{v,\,cm}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>CMRR stands for common-mode rejection ratio which is
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{CMRR} = 20\log{\bigg(\frac{A_{v,\,\text{diff}}}{A_{v,\,cm}}\bigg)}\)</span>\)</span>
A typically value is around <span class="arithmatex">\(\SI{80}{\decibel}\)</span>.</p>
<p>-4ex -1ex -.4ex 1ex .2ex Mismatch In the design stage, we always assume

<p>-2ex -0.1ex -.2ex .2ex .2ex Auto-Zeroing Technique To demonstrate the
auto-zeroing, we have switches that are controlled by the input signal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(\phi = 1\)</span>, we have a virtual short, where <span class="arithmatex">\(v^+ = v^-\)</span>, and the
    capacitor is charged to <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{os}\)</span> with polarity shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(\phi = 0\)</span>, it does some magic and the voltage of the capacitor
    cancels out <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{os}\)</span>. Then poof, the offset voltage goes bye bye.</p>
</li>
</ul>

:::</p>
<p>Some remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(v_{os}\)</span> needs to remain unchanged during both <span class="arithmatex">\(\phi = 0\)</span> and
    <span class="arithmatex">\(\phi 1\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(v_o\)</span> is not available during <span class="arithmatex">\(\phi = 1\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switches are implemented using MOSFET.</p>
</li>
</ul>
